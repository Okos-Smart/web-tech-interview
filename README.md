# Lexter Tech Interview Boilerplate

This codebase is a **deliberately buggy React + TypeScript project** created for Lexter’s technical interviews. Its purpose is to let candidates demonstrate their ability to **navigate an unfamiliar codebase**, **debug issues**, and show adaptability to different coding patterns.

**Important:** The application contains intentional bugs and omissions. You are expected to identify and fix these during the interview. Likewise, documentation is minimal by design – reading the code and configuration will be part of the evaluation

Candidates should consider the _entire_ codebase during the exercise. The project’s structure (routes, components, hooks, etc.) is similar to what you’d find in a real-world app, albeit with some twists to test your understanding. Don’t be alarmed if something doesn’t work at first; use your debugging skills to figure out why.

We recommend running the app and exploring its functionality. Pay attention to error messages or unexpected behavior – they are clues to the issues we’ve planted. Solving these will demonstrate your technical problem-solving skills.

Feel free to ask clarifying questions during the interview. Good luck, and happy debugging!
